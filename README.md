Tipr
----

Tipr is a small and simple jQuery tooltip plugin.

Wait? didn't Tipue make this?
----
Absolutely! But [they are too lazy](https://github.com/Tipue/Tipr/issues/15) to
publish Tipr on npm, and since they released this software under MIT I just
uploaded it right there for easier usage.

To get started, see <http://www.tipue.com/tipr/>. There's a demo at <http://www.tipue.com/tipr/>.
